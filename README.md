# UFC Fighter Analysis

## Overview
The **UFC Fighter Analysis Dashboard** is a project that explores trends and insights in UFC fight data. By combining Python, MySQL and Tableau, this project makes it easy to dive into fighter stats, fight outcomes, and weight-class trends.

## Features
- Data Cleaning, Loading, and Querying: Python scripts to clean raw CSV data, load it into a MySQL database, and then query it for insight.
- Interactive Visualizations: Tableau dashboards to explore trends like KO rates in title vs non-title bouts and more.
- Jupyter Notebook Analysis: A notebook tying everything together with additional analysis and visualizations.


## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- MySQL Server
- Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `sqlalchemy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `jupyter`
- Tableau (optional for visualizations)

## Future Ideas
- Add predictions for fight outcomes using machine learning.
- Build a tool to find value via betting odds from fighter stats and predictions
- Build an interactive web app with Flask or Dash.
